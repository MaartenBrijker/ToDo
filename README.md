App that displays a todo list. Items can be added or deleted by user interaction. 
Uses a SQLite database for saving user's todo's.

ps: For some reason the SQLite database does work on my initial file 
but not if I download that file from Github and then try to run it...

pps: sorry for handing in this problem set after the deadline..
I already had the problem set done by friday
and honestly just forget to upload it in the weekend.
as I was occupied writing my thesis and made some stressy hours...
Wont happen again!
